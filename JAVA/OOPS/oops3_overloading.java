// overloading functions- when in a clas there are multiple functions with same name but with different parameters , order of parameters and return type but only different return type will not be consider as method overloading
//No, a method cannot be overloaded if it only differs in return type while having the same method name and same parameters.If only the return type is different, Java will give a compile-time error.
// We can do completely different functionality in a overloading function just keep in mind the overloading functions rules in mind, like in one process() function we can create a loop , in other process() we are finding area just keep the overloading rules .(In Java, you can add additional logic, variables, conditions, loops, and even method calls inside overloaded functions.)
//Overloading happens within a class or in a subclass through inheritance.
//final method cannot be overriden
